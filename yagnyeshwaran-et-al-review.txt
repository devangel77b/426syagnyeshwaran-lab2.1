This is a review of the MS "Proving F=ma" by Yagnyeshwaran et al. I recommend
MAJOR REVISION NEEDED - RESUBMIT.

Title: This paper is not a mathematical proof so the use of the word "proving"
is inappropriate here. The authors hypothesize F=0 or F=ma or F=? and show that
alternatives are not happening, so we provisionally accept F=ma until we
find something better... and we woudl need something better if we were moving
at v near speed of light so that relativity mattered, for example.

Abstract: Same objection to word proof. It is not typical to include references or equations in an abstract.

INtroduction: clean

Methods and materials: mostly clean, however it would be nice to include sources
for important gear so the work can be more easily replicated. The lab setup
diagram has no scale given but is the most readable of these I have seen;
authors should consider a diagram. Authors should be careful about the
difference between mass and weight.

Results:
The authors say they are out to test either F=ma or a = m2/m1+m2 g
but do not plot either. The graphs in the results are confusing and do not
directly address the hypothesis the authors wish to test. See also similar
graphs for Avalur et al; if the test was conducted in a way that mass is constant you might plot F = ma or a=m2/m1+m2 g. If total system mass is also changing
you might plot a/g versus m2/m1+m2 as a nondimensionalized version of the data.

Discussion:
Yes or no does F=ma? Explain.

Then discuss things like friction or timing errors or other sources of experimetnal error.

One refernce is given but it is not cited anywhere in the text
