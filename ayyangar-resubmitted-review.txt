This is a review of the resubmitted ms "Verifying F=ma" by Ayyangar et al. I recommend minor revisions.

F=ma should have a citation.

"analog scale (Manalapan, NJ)" I think the authors mean a spring scale? It is typical to give the manufacturer and their location, e.g. "cart (PASCO Scientific, Roseville, CA)."

"downward mass" - Mass has no direction? Do they mean hanging mass? ARe the different masses on the cart in addition to the 0.5 kg cart mass?

The MS gives equations for mean and standard deviation; these are standard and do not need to be included here. It is sufficient to say that you are providing measurements as the mean +/- 1 s.d. ("Average" here should be avoided as there are many different averages that could be used).

In Fig (3) there is experimental data and a best fit line but the methods do not explain what the equation is for the best fit line. Please explain.
